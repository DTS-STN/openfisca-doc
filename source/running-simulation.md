# How to calculate the legislation on people situations?

You have an OpenFisca tax and benefits system and you want to calculate some legislation variables on people situations.

## Test case

###### Application: how to initialize a scenario

Test cases can be expressed in Python, or in JSON when using the Web API (see the [specific section](../openfisca-web-api/input-output-data.md) of the documentation).

In Python, you have to use the `init_single_entity` function based on the *scenario*. To give to every person of your *test case* attributes, you have to use the Python dictionary object.

We show here the Python expression for a family constituted by:

- two parents (with attributes: her `age` or her `date_naissance` and her `salaire_de_base`)
- two children (with attribute: their `age`)
- a house (with attributes: the `loyer` and the `statut_occupation_logement`)

```python
# Initialize test case
scenario.init_single_entity(
    period = 2015,
# Variable describing the individuals
    parent1 = dict(
        age = 30,
        salaire_de_base = 15000, # Annual basis
        ),
    parent2 = dict(
        date_naissance = date(1980, 1, 1),
        salaire_de_base = 70000, # Annual basis
        ),
     enfants = [
        dict(age = 12),
        dict(age = 18),
        ],
 # Variable describing the entity
    menage = dict(loyer = 12000, # Annual basis
            statut_occupation_logement = u"Locataire ou sous-locataire
                                      d'un logement louÃ© vide non-HLM",
            ),
    )
   ```

Notice that some input variables are associated to *individus* ("parent1" , "parent2" and "children") whereas other are related to *entity* ("menage").

> **WARNING**: Declare the *input variables* on an annual basis.

HINT: For categorical variables you may use either the modality or its number.
Example with the [statut d'occupation du logement](https://fr.openfisca.org/legislation/statut_occupation_logement):
 ``` python
 # Declaration of categorical variable
 menage = dict(loyer = 12000,
            statut_occupation_logement = 4,
            )

```
